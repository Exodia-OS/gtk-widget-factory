AWF - A Widget Factory
======================

Description
-----------

A widget factory is a theme preview application for gtk2 and gtk3.
It displays the various widget types provided by gtk2/gtk3 in a single window allowing to see the visual effect of the applied theme.

Status
------

**Warning**: it's quite some time I haven't looked at gtk3 to integrate the latest widgets, and I don't plan to work on this tool anymore.
AWF was indeed created a long time ago when neither gtk2 nor gtk3 were providing such a tool.  
As part of gtk3 there is now [gtk3-widget-factory](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk3-widget-factory.html) and gtk4 will provide [gtk4-widget-factory](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk4/stable/gtk4-widget-factory.html).

Features
--------

  * Display widget types available in gtk2/gtk3 (remark: option menu widget type only exists in gtk2, switch and level bar widget types only exist in gtk3)
  * Menus to select the themes available either at system level or user level
  * Toolbar button to start the other gtk version of the tool
  * Toolbar button to refresh the current theme (not working anymore in latest versions of gtk3)
  * Refresh the current theme on SIGHUP
